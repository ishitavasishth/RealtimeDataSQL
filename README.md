# RealtimeDataSQL

**Overview**

This repository showcases my journey through the SQL Elective Course as part of my graduate studies in Marketing Analytics at UT Austin. It includes SQL exercises performed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), covering key database management concepts using MySQL on an RDS instance.

**Areas Explored**

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, joins.

**Data Definition Language (DDL):** Creating, modifying, and structuring database schemas.

**Intermediate SQL:** Aggregations, subqueries, grouping, and window functions.

**Advanced SQL:** Recursive queries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), case statements, and optimization techniques.

**Key Highlights**

AWS RDS Connection:

Established a secure MySQL connection using Python (Jupyter Notebook) with SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL.

Managed user authentication and permissions using AWS credentials.

**Query Optimization & Performance Tuning:**

Efficiently retrieved large datasets by leveraging indexes and optimized joins.

Used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to diagnose and optimize queries.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

Customer Analytics: Identified key customer segments based on transactional behavior.

Sales Trends: Performed aggregations on purchase history to analyze revenue patterns.

Product Performance: Implemented ranking queries to determine top-performing products.
